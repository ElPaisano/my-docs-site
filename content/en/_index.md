The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is an open-source, decentralized, distributed, censorship-resistant peer-to-peer file system built for Web3. IPFS uses technology like content-based addressing, Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and Distribute Hash Tables (DHTs) to power the next generation of Internet. Many popular Web3 projects, like Filecoin are built on IPFS.
