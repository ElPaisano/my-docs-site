**IPFS Desktop bundles an IPFS node, file manager, peer manager, and content explorer into a single, easy-to-use application.**

Use IPFS Desktop to get acquainted with IPFS without needing to touch the terminal — or, if you're already experienced, use the powerful menubar/taskbar shortcuts alongside the command line to make your IPFS workflow faster.

If you already have an IPFS node on your computer, IPFS Desktop will simply act as a control panel and file browser for that node. On the other hand, if you don't have a node, Desktop will install one for you. Additionally, Desktop will automatically check for updates.

## Features

- **Start your node on system startup (Mac/Windows) and control it from your OS** using the convenient menubar/system tray menu.
- **Quickly import files, folders, and screenshots to IPFS** in a variety of convenient ways, including drag-and-drop and (for Windows) right-clicking a file/folder's icon.
- **Easily manage the contents of your node** with a familiar file browser that offers quick shortcuts for renaming/moving/pinning files and folders, previewing many common file formats directly in IPFS Desktop, copying content IDs or shareable links to your clipboard, and more.
- **Quick download for CIDs, IPFS paths, and IPNS paths** — choose `Download...` by right-clicking the IPFS icon on your computer's menubar, paste in a hash, and you're good to go.
- **Visualize your IPFS peers worldwide** on a map depicting what nodes you're connected to, where they are, the connections they're using, and more.
- **Explore the "Merkle Forest" of IPFS files** with a visualizer that lets you see firsthand how example datasets stored on IPFS — or your own IPFS files — are broken down into content-addressed pieces.
- **OS-wide support for IPFS files and links** (on Mac, Windows, and some Linux flavors) automatically hands off links starting with `ipfs://`, `ipns://` and `dweb:` to be opened in IPFS Desktop.
- **CLI Tutor Mode** helps you learn IPFS commands as you go.

The following installtion instructions are specific to Ubuntu Linux. To install IPFS Desktop on a non-Ubuntu Linux distributions, see the [IPFS Desktop GitHub repository](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop#install).

### Install using AppImage

:::warning
When installing IPFS Desktop using an AppImage executable, you will not have access to the command-line `ipfs` commands. This limitation is due to how AppImages work and how they containerize their processes.

:::

1. Download the latest `.AppImage` package from the [IPFS Desktop GitHub repository](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop#linuxfreebsd).
2. Move into where you downloaded the `.AppImage` file, and make it executable:

   ```shell
   cd Downloads
