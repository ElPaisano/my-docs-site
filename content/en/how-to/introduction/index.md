Wondering how to add a file, configure your node profile, or modify the node bootstrap list? Great, welcome to the How-To section of the IPFS Docs! Here, you can learn how to perform all of these actions (and much more) using the various IPFS implementations and tools. Before getting started, read through the introduction material below.

## How to use to use the How-To section (no pun entended)

Before selecting an action, answer the following questions:
1. _What tool / implementation do you want to use?_ If you're unfamiliar with the available tools and implementations, see [Tools]({{< relref "basics/introduction/overview/index.md#tools" >}}) and [Implementations]({{< relref "basics/introduction/overview/index.md#implementations" >}})
2. _Have you installed the implementation / tool?_ If not, head over to the [overview]({{< relref "basics/introduction/overview/index.md" >}}) section and select the appropriate quickstart guide.
3. _What action (or actions) you want to perform?_ For example, you might want to add a file to your node.
4. _Have you completed all of the necessary prerequisites?_ For example, before adding a file in Kubo, you must have Kubo installed and have and IPFS node running.

<u>Remember</u>: Because IPFS implementations and tools do not necessarily have feature parity, certain actions can only be performed using a specific implementation or tool.
